# ☁️ AWS LABS

### Hands-On AWS Cloud Engineering Portfolio

> **20 production-style labs** covering networking, compute, storage, security, serverless, and infrastructure-as-code — each documented with architecture diagrams, implementation steps, real commands, and troubleshooting notes.

## 🎯 Why This Repository Exists

Most cloud certifications test theory. This repository tests **execution**.

Every lab here is built from scratch, manually configured, and documented the way real engineers document their work — with architecture context, the exact CLI commands used, what broke, and how it was fixed. The goal is to build the kind of AWS muscle memory that shows up in production environments.

## 📈 Learning Objectives

- [ ] Build strong AWS fundamentals across 6+ service categories
- [ ] Understand cloud networking end-to-end (VPC → DNS → Load Balancing)
- [ ] Apply AWS security best practices (IAM, NACLs, SGs, Bastion)
- [ ] Deploy serverless and event-driven architectures (Lambda, SQS, SNS)
- [ ] Write infrastructure-as-code with CloudFormation
- [ ] Develop real troubleshooting instincts through hands-on failures
- [ ] Build a documented portfolio that demonstrates cloud engineering depth

## 🚀 Lab 01 Highlight — VPC & Network ACLs

> The foundation of everything in AWS. Before EC2 can talk to the internet, before load balancers can route traffic, before RDS can accept a connection — networking has to be right.

**What was built:**
- Custom VPC with public and private subnets across 2 AZs
- Internet Gateway attached and route tables configured
- Network ACLs layered on top of Security Groups
- Tested inbound/outbound traffic rules with real EC2 instances
